# Project 4: Declarative Configuration
## Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a declarative configuration for our fictional business "CraftRoast". This project will cover how to create and deploy declarative configuration on a real server.

You will have the option of using either PyInfra or Ansible. I recommend Ansible if you are truly interested in this field over PyInfra. You will be completing this project in pairs.


## Prompt
CraftRoast is looking to modernize their infrastructure. After their last outage they are looking to clean up their system to make updates and troubleshooting easier. They've hired you (and your partner) to create a declarative configuration for their system to make maintanence easier. Currently CraftRoast has the following:

- A digital E-Commerce Site (https://devdocs.bagisto.com/getting-started/installation.html#%F0%9F%90%B3-docker-installation)
- A grafana instance for monitoring their e-commerce site
- 2 Developers who need accounts to access their sites
SSH needs to be set up for these developers
- 1 Admin account, separate from the developers


## Requirements
1. The project will be completed in assigned groups of 2.

2. Each Team member will complete an individual report on the project.

You should know what's going on, even if you aren't doing anything that week
4. By the end of the 3 weeks, you should have written the declarative configuration.

5. You must put all the files into a GitHub Repository with appropriate documentation.



The goal of this project is to have this deployed on the servers, however given the timeframe, we'll see if we can get that far. You will need at least the configuration set up.



## Reflection
Each member of the team should complete a reflection. This reflection serves as documentation of your efforts and summarization of your knowledge. These are to be submitted independently. You should not simply copy another teammates reflection, you need to write your own.



Your reflection needs to answer the following questions:

1. What was the purpose of this project in your own words?
2. Describe each task. What did that task accomplish, how did you accomplish it. Use complete sentences.
3. Explain 3 hurdles/misconceptions you encountered whilst working on the project. How did you overcome these hurdles?
4. Explain 2 things you would do differently if you had to re-do this project?
5. (Extra Credit +2 Pts) What is something that could be improved in this project? This could be related to tasks, grouping, the servers, etc. If all you add is that it should've worked the first time that's not enough.
